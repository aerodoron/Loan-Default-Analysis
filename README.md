# Loan-Default-Analysis
The purpose of this report is to examine the data set of the bank's clients' and examine their credit score, so the bank may be able to evaluate whether a client who was granted a loan by the bank will be able to repay his or her loan or will they default on the loan.  In the report hereinafter, I will test the hypotheses that a loanee's personal status or their number of children have any affect on their ability to repay the loan or not.  To complete the analysis and draw conclusions, I will remove duplicated rows, fix problematic values in the data, fill in missing values and group the clients' data, as required.
